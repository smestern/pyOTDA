    "The aim of this package is to facilitate the integration of patch clamp electrophysiology datasets. Due to the sensitivity of patch clamp electrophysiological recordings to a variety of different extraneous variables, for example, temperature, solution, region, etc.\n",

    "patchOTDA is a small python package that wraps several optimal transport based domain adaptation packages. The package aims to help intermediate users integrate two datasets by following simple OOP conventions.  \n",
    " \n",
    "End users are encouraged to check out the streamlit app: https://patchotda.streamlit.app/. This app allows you to integrate your dataset with a reference dataset from the Allen Institute.\n"
